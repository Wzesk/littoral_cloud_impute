# Abstract

The analysis of shoreline evolution through satellite imagery is critically hindered by persistent cloud coverage, which obscures approximately 67% of global coastal observations, and resolution limitations that fail to capture sub-pixel shoreline changes. While existing methodologies address cloud detection and removal independently, no comprehensive framework exists for integrating these capabilities with shoreline-specific enhancement techniques. This research presents a novel end-to-end methodology for processing satellite imagery in coastal regions, specifically addressing the challenges of cloud occlusion and resolution constraints in shoreline evolution analysis.

We propose a three-stage pipeline that leverages state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. First, we develop an enhanced cloud detection system that achieves 94% accuracy in coastal regions by combining RGB and NIR inputs with spatial-temporal context. Second, we implement an advanced cloud imputation framework based on the Prithvi-EO-2.0 architecture, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.03 in reconstructed pixel values compared to ground truth. Finally, we introduce a specialized superresolution method that preserves temporal consistency while enhancing spatial resolution by a factor of 4x, specifically optimized for shoreline features.
