# Introduction and Overview

## Research Question
How can we best amalgamate existing, public satellite imagery into a dataproduct suitable for shoreline evolution timeseries analysis?

## Background
Satellite imagery provides an invaluable resource for monitoring coastal evolution, offering regular, wide-area coverage of shorelines worldwide. However, two significant challenges limit its effectiveness:

1. **Cloud Occlusion**: Clouds frequently obscure critical shoreline areas, creating gaps in temporal analysis.
2. **Resolution Limitations**: Standard satellite imagery may not capture fine-grain shoreline changes effectively.

## Research Goals

### Goal 1: Cloud Detection from Adjacent Pixels
**Objective**: Infer the state of pixels obscured by clouds from adjacent clouds (adjacent in space or time).

**Challenges**:
- Distinguishing between clouds, cloud shadows, and natural features
- Handling varying cloud types and densities
- Maintaining accuracy near water-land boundaries

**Approach**:
- Leverage RGB+NIR inputs for robust cloud detection
- Implement state-of-the-art methods like OmniCloudMask and CloudS2Mask
- Optimize detection specifically for coastal regions

### Goal 2: Cloud Imputation from Alternative Products
**Objective**: Infer the state of pixels obscured by clouds from alternative imagery products.

**Challenges**:
- Aligning data from different sources and timestamps
- Handling varying resolutions and spectral bands
- Ensuring temporal consistency in reconstructed areas

**Approach**:
- Implement Prithvi-EO-2.0 architecture for cloud imputation
- Develop methods for multi-source data fusion
- Incorporate temporal consistency constraints

### Goal 3: Shoreline Superresolution
**Objective**: Superresolve shoreline pixels while preserving fine-grain changes over time.

**Challenges**:
- Preserving temporal consistency
- Maintaining accurate water-land boundaries
- Avoiding artifacts in enhanced imagery

**Approach**:
- Develop specialized superresolution for shoreline areas
- Leverage temporal information for enhanced detail
- Implement validation methods specific to shoreline features

## Significance
This research addresses critical gaps in satellite-based coastal monitoring:
1. **Data Continuity**: Reducing the impact of cloud cover on temporal analysis
2. **Detail Enhancement**: Improving the resolution of shoreline features
3. **Automation**: Developing methods that can be applied at scale

## Expected Outcomes
1. A comprehensive pipeline for processing satellite imagery of coastal regions
2. Novel methods for cloud detection and imputation optimized for shorelines
3. Improved techniques for shoreline feature enhancement
4. Open-source implementations of developed methods
