# Introduction

## Background and Motivation

Coastal zones, which host approximately 40% of the global population and critical infrastructure valued at over $1.8 trillion, face unprecedented challenges from climate change and anthropogenic pressures. Accurate monitoring of shoreline evolution is essential for coastal management, yet existing satellite-based approaches face significant limitations. While satellite platforms like Sentinel-2 and Landsat provide regular coverage of coastal regions, their effectiveness is severely compromised by persistent cloud coverage, which affects up to 67% of global coastal observations, and resolution constraints that fail to capture fine-scale shoreline changes.

## Current State of the Field

| Aspect | Current Capabilities | Limitations | Research Gap |
|--------|---------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Cloud Detection | Traditional spectral methods, ML-based approaches | Limited accuracy in coastal regions (70-85%) | Need for specialized coastal detection |
| Cloud Removal | Single-image inpainting, basic fusion | Temporal inconsistency, artifact introduction | Lack of shoreline-specific methods |
| Resolution | Generic super-resolution (2-3x) | Loss of temporal consistency | No shoreline-optimized enhancement |

## Technical Challenges

| Challenge | Impact on Shoreline Analysis | Current Solutions | Limitations |
|-----------|----------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Cloud Persistence | 67% data loss in coastal regions | Temporal compositing | Loss of dynamic changes |
| Mixed Pixels | Reduced accuracy at water-land boundary | Spectral unmixing | Limited sub-pixel accuracy |
| Resolution Gaps | Missing fine-scale changes | Generic upsampling | Feature degradation |
