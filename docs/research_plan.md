# Research Plan

## Research Goals

1. **Cloud Pixel Inference (Goal 1)**
   - Develop methods to infer the state of pixels obscured by clouds
   - Utilize RGB and NIR inputs for accurate cloud detection
   - Implement cloud masking using omnicloudmask library

2. **Alternative Product Integration (Goal 2)**
   - Infer obscured pixels using alternative imagery products
   - Implement Prithvi-EO-2.0 architecture for cloud imputation
   - Develop methods for combining multiple data sources

3. **Shoreline Superresolution (Goal 3)**
   - Enhance resolution of shoreline pixels
   - Preserve fine-grain details in shoreline areas
   - Develop methods for accurate shoreline delineation

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Cloud Detection and Masking
- Implement RGB+NIR based cloud detection
- Validate cloud mask accuracy
- Optimize for shoreline regions

### Phase 2: Cloud Imputation
- Implement Prithvi-EO-2.0 based imputation
- Train on shoreline-specific datasets
- Validate imputation quality

### Phase 3: Superresolution
- Develop shoreline-specific superresolution
- Integrate with imputation results
- Validate final predictions
