"""Littoral Cloud Imputation package for satellite imagery analysis.

This package provides tools for detecting and removing clouds from satellite imagery,
with a focus on shoreline analysis. It includes modules for cloud detection, cloud
imputation using deep learning, and planned functionality for shoreline superresolution.

Main components:
    - cloud_mask: Cloud detection using RGB+NIR imagery
    - cloud_impute: Cloud removal using Prithvi-EO-2.0 architecture
    - superresolution: Shoreline detail enhancement (planned)
