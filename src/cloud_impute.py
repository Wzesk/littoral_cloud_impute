"""Cloud imputation module using Prithvi-EO-2.0 architecture.

This module implements the core cloud imputation functionality using the Prithvi-EO-2.0
transformer model. It serves as the primary component for reconstructing cloud-obscured
regions in satellite imagery, particularly optimized for shoreline analysis.

The module leverages Prithvi-EO-2.0's capabilities:
1. Multi-temporal fusion for consistent reconstruction
2. Attention-based mechanisms for spatial context
3. Transformer architecture for handling variable cloud coverage
4. Built-in handling of metadata and geolocation

class CloudImputation:
    """Cloud imputation model using Prithvi-EO-2.0 architecture.

    This class implements the Prithvi-EO-2.0 architecture for removing clouds from
    satellite imagery and reconstructing the underlying surface features. It focuses
    on accurate reconstruction of shoreline regions through specialized training
    and optimization.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    path : str or Path, optional
        Directory containing model parameters and weights, by default "/prithvi_params"

    Attributes:
    ----------
    path : Path

    yml_path : Path
        Path to the data configuration YAML file
    weights_path : Path
        Path to the model weights file

    Notes:
    -----
    The implementation uses Prithvi-EO-2.0's transformer architecture which offers:
    - Built-in temporal fusion capabilities
    - Attention mechanisms for spatial context
    - Efficient handling of missing data
    - Geolocation-aware processing
