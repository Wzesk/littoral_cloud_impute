"""Cloud imputation module using Prithvi-EO-2.0 architecture.

This module implements cloud imputation functionality using the Prithvi-EO-2.0 model
architecture. It provides capabilities for training and inference on satellite imagery
to remove clouds and reconstruct the underlying surface features.
